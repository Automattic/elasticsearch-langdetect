Elasticsearch Langdetect Plugin
===============================

This is an implementation of a plugin for `Elasticsearch <http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch>`_ using the 
implementation of Nakatani Shuyo's `language detector <http://code.google.com/p/language-detection/>`_.

It uses 3-gram character and a Bayesian filter with various normalizations and feature sampling. The precision is over 99% for 53 languages.

The plugin offers a REST endpoint where a short text can be posted in UTF-8, and Elasticsearch responds with a list of recognized languages.

Currently, it does not provide automatic language-aware indexing. It is just `"sugar coating" <https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/489>`_. You have to evaluate the response by yourself and take the appropriate language-dependent action.

Installation
------------

The current version of the plugin is **1.0.0**

In order to install the plugin, please run

``bin/plugin -install jprante/elasticsearch-langdetect/1.0.0``.

Be aware, in case the version number is omitted, you will have the source code installed for manual compilation.
